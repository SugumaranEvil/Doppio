-----
Closing the Ledger account and calculating the balance in the Ledger account --> Preparing Trial balance --> Preparing Profit and Loss account, Balancesheet and Notes to accounts

### There are two approches of understanding debit credit rules :
1. Accounting Equation based on Dual Concept
2. Golden Rules of accounting
Note : The Final debit credit rule is same whichever approach is followed.In other words Journal Entry passed for particular financial transaction will be same
incase of Accounting equation debit credit rules and Golden Rules of accounting.
